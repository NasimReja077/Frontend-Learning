Let’s dive into a comprehensive, in-depth exploration of **React's `useState` hook**. I’ll cover its explanation, examples, practical exercises with answers, and common interview questions with detailed answers. This guide assumes familiarity with JavaScript and basic React concepts but will be thorough enough for both beginners and advanced learners.

## **1. Explanation of React `useState`**

### **What is `useState`?**
`useState` is a React Hook introduced in React 16.8 to manage state in functional components. Before Hooks, state management was primarily handled in class components using `this.state` and `this.setState`. With `useState`, functional components can maintain their own state, making them more powerful and reducing the need for class components.

- **Purpose**: Allows functional components to have local state that persists across renders.
- **Syntax**: 
  ```javascript
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
  ```
  - `state`: The current state value.
  - `setState`: A function to update the state.
  - `initialState`: The initial value of the state (can be a primitive, object, array, etc.).
  - Returns an array with two elements: the state variable and its setter function.

### **How `useState` Works**
- When you call `useState`, React creates a state variable and associates it with the component instance.
- The state is preserved across re-renders unless explicitly updated via `setState`.
- Calling `setState` schedules a re-render with the new state value.
- React compares the new state with the previous state (using `Object.is`) to determine if a re-render is needed.
- `useState` is **component-scoped**, meaning each component instance has its own state.

### **Key Characteristics**
1. **Immutability**: `setState` does not mutate the state directly; it replaces it with a new value.
2. **Asynchronous Updates**: `setState` is asynchronous, so state updates may not be immediate. Use the callback form of `setState` for updates that depend on the previous state.
3. **Batching**: React batches multiple `setState` calls within the same event handler to optimize performance.
4. **Lazy Initialization**: The `initialState` can be a function to compute the initial state lazily, which is useful for expensive computations.

### **When to Use `useState`**
- For managing simple, local state in functional components (e.g., form inputs, counters, toggles).
- When you don’t need complex state logic (use `useReducer` for that).
- When state changes should trigger a re-render.

---

## **2. Detailed Examples**

Below are practical examples to illustrate `useState` usage, from basic to advanced scenarios.

### **Example 1: Basic Counter**
A simple counter that increments or decrements a number.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `useState(0)` initializes `count` to 0.
- `setCount(count + 1)` updates the state, triggering a re-render with the new `count` value.
- The component re-renders whenever `count` changes.

### **Example 2: Handling Form Input**
Managing form input state, such as a text input.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function NameForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setName(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={name} onChange={handleChange} />
      <p>Hello, {name || 'Guest'}!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `useState('')` initializes `name` as an empty string.
- The `onChange` event updates `name` via `setName`.
- The input is controlled, meaning its value is driven by the `name` state.

### **Example 3: Managing Complex State (Object)**
Using an object as state to manage multiple form fields.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function UserForm() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    firstName: '',
    lastName: '',
    email: '',
  });

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    const { name, value } = event.target;
    setFormData((prevData) => ({
      ...prevData,
      [name]: value,
    }));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        name="firstName"
        value={formData.firstName}
        onChange={handleChange}
        placeholder="First Name"
      />
      <input
        type="text"
        name="lastName"
        value={formData.lastName}
        onChange={handleChange}
        placeholder="Last Name"
      />
      <input
        type="email"
        name="email"
        value={formData.email}
        onChange={handleChange}
        placeholder="Email"
      />
      <p>
        Full Name: {formData.firstName} {formData.lastName}
      </p>
      <p>Email: {formData.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `useState` initializes an object with multiple properties.
- `setFormData` uses the functional update form (`prevData`) to safely update a specific property while preserving others using the spread operator (`...`).
- The `name` attribute on inputs allows dynamic updates to the correct field.

### **Example 4: Lazy Initialization**
Using a function for expensive initial state computation.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ExpensiveComponent() {
  const expensiveInitialState = () => {
    console.log('Computing initial state...');
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
  };

  const [value, setValue] = useState(expensiveInitialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Random Value: {value}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setValue(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100))}>
        Generate New
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `expensiveInitialState` runs only once during the initial render.
- This is useful for costly computations (e.g., fetching data or complex calculations) to avoid running unnecessarily.

### **Example 5: Array State**
Managing an array of items, such as a todo list.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  const addTodo = () => {
    if (input.trim()) {
      setTodos((prevTodos) => [...prevTodos, input]);
      setInput('');
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={input}
        onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Add a todo"
      />
      <button onClick={addTodo}>Add</button>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{todo}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Explanation**:
- Two state variables: `todos` (array) and `input` (string).
- `setTodos` uses the functional update to append new items to the array.
- The input is cleared after adding a todo.

## **3. Practical Exercises (with Answers)**

### **Exercise 1: Toggle Switch**
**Task**: Create a toggle switch component that changes between "On" and "Off" when a button is clicked.

**Solution**:
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ToggleSwitch() {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  const toggle = () => {
    setIsOn((prev) => !prev);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Switch is {isOn ? 'On' : 'Off'}</p>
      <button onClick={toggle}>Toggle</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ToggleSwitch;
```

**Explanation**:
- `useState(false)` initializes the switch to "Off".
- The `toggle` function flips the boolean state using the functional update form.
- The UI updates based on the `isOn` state.

### **Exercise 2: Shopping Cart Counter**
**Task**: Create a component to manage a shopping cart’s item count with "Add" and "Remove" buttons. Prevent the count from going below 0.

**Solution**:
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function CartCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const addItem = () => {
    setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
  };

  const removeItem = () => {
    setCount((prev) => (prev > 0 ? prev - 1 : 0));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Items in Cart: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={addItem}>Add Item</button>
      <button onClick={removeItem}>Remove Item</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default CartCounter;
```

**Explanation**:
- `useState(0)` initializes the cart count.
- `removeItem` ensures the count doesn’t go negative.
- Functional updates are used for safe state transitions.

### **Exercise 3: Dynamic List with Delete**
**Task**: Build a component where users can add items to a list and delete specific items.

**Solution**:
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ItemList() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  const addItem = () => {
    if (input.trim()) {
      setItems((prev) => [...prev, input]);
      setInput('');
    }
  };

  const deleteItem = (index) => {
    setItems((prev) => prev.filter((_, i) => i !== index));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={input}
        onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Add an item"
      />
      <button onClick={addItem}>Add</button>
      <ul>
        {items.map((item, index) => (
          <li key={index}>
            {item} <button onClick={() => deleteItem(index)}>Delete</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ItemList;
```

**Explanation**:
- `items` stores the list, and `input` manages the text input.
- `addItem` appends the input to the list and clears the input.
- `deleteItem` filters out the item at the specified index.

## **4. Common Interview Questions (with Answers)**

### **Question 1: What is the `useState` hook, and how does it differ from `this.state` in class components?**
**Answer**:
- **Definition**: `useState` is a React Hook that allows functional components to manage local state. It returns a state variable and a setter function.
- **Differences from `this.state`**:
  - **Component Type**: `useState` is used in functional components, while `this.state` is used in class components.
  - **Syntax**: `useState` is simpler, requiring a single line to declare state, whereas `this.state` requires a constructor or class property for initialization.
  - **State Updates**: `setState` in `useState` replaces the state entirely, while `this.setState` merges updates into the existing state.
  - **Multiple States**: With `useState`, you can declare multiple state variables independently. With `this.state`, all state is stored in a single object.
  - **Functional Updates**: `useState` encourages functional updates (e.g., `setCount(prev => prev + 1)`) for safe state updates, while `this.setState` supports both direct updates and functional updates.

### **Question 2: How do you update state based on the previous state? Why is this important?**
**Answer**:
- **How**: Use the functional update form of the setter function:
  ```javascript
  setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  ```
- **Why**: `setState` is asynchronous, and multiple `setState` calls may be batched. If you rely on the current state value (e.g., `setCount(count + 1)`), you might use a stale value if another update is pending. The functional update form ensures you always work with the latest state.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1); // May use stale count
    setCount((prev) => prev + 1); // Always uses latest state
  };
  ```

### **Question 3: Can you use `useState` with complex data types like objects or arrays? How do you update them correctly?**
**Answer**:
- Yes, `useState` supports complex data types like objects and arrays.
- **Updating Objects**: Use the spread operator to preserve existing properties:
  ```javascript
  const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: '', age: 0 });
  setUser((prev) => ({ ...prev, name: 'Alice' }));
  ```
- **Updating Arrays**: Use array methods like `map`, `filter`, or spread to create a new array:
  ```javascript
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  setItems((prev) => [...prev, 'new item']);
  ```
- **Why Correctly**: Directly mutating the state (e.g., `items.push('new item')`) won’t trigger a re-render because React relies on reference changes. Always return a new object/array.

### **Question 4: What happens if you call `setState` multiple times in a single event handler?**
**Answer**:
- React batches multiple `setState` calls within the same event handler to optimize performance, queuing them and applying the final state in a single re-render.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1); // Queued
    setCount(count + 1); // Queued, but uses stale count
    // Result: count becomes 1, not 2
  };
  ```
- **Solution**: Use functional updates to ensure correct state:
  ```javascript
  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
    setCount((prev) => prev + 1); // Result: count becomes 2
  };
  ```

### **Question 5: What is lazy initialization in `useState`, and when would you use it?**
**Answer**:
- **Lazy Initialization**: You can pass a function to `useState` to compute the initial state. This function runs only once during the component’s first render.
  ```javascript
  const [value, setValue] = useState(() => expensiveComputation());
  ```
- **When to Use**: Use lazy initialization for expensive computations (e.g., complex calculations, parsing large data) to avoid running them unnecessarily on every render.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const expensiveComputation = () => {
    console.log('Computing...');
    return Math.random();
  };
  
  const [value, setValue] = useState(expensiveComputation);
  // 'Computing...' logs only once
  ```

### **Question 6: How would you handle a form with multiple inputs using a single `useState` hook?**
**Answer**:
- Use an object to store all form fields in a single state variable. Update the state dynamically using the input’s `name` attribute.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    username: '',
    password: '',
  });

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setFormData((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      [name]: value,
    }));
  };

  return (
    <form>
      <input name="username" value={formData.username} onChange={handleChange} />
      <input name="password" value={formData.password} onChange={handleChange} />
    </form>
  );
  ```
- **Benefits**: Reduces the number of state variables and keeps related data together.
- **Note**: Use the functional update form to avoid overwriting unrelated fields.

---

## **5. Best Practices for Using `useState`**
1. **Keep State Minimal**: Only store data that affects rendering or component logic.
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Name state variables clearly (e.g., `count` instead of `x`).
3. **Avoid Direct Mutations**: Always create new objects/arrays when updating complex state.
4. **Use Functional Updates**: For state updates that depend on the previous state.
5. **Split State When Necessary**: If state variables are unrelated, use multiple `useState` calls for clarity.
6. **Consider `useReducer` for Complex State**: If state logic becomes complex (e.g., multiple interdependent updates), switch to `useReducer`.

---

## **6. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them**
1. **Stale State**:
   - **Problem**: Using the current state value in `setState` can lead to stale data.
   - **Solution**: Use functional updates: `setState(prev => prev + 1)`.
2. **Mutating State Directly**:
   - **Problem**: Modifying arrays/objects directly (e.g., `array.push()`) doesn’t trigger re-renders.
   - **Solution**: Create new arrays/objects: `setArray([...array, newItem])`.
3. **Overusing `useState`**:
   - **Problem**: Too many `useState` calls can make code harder to manage.
   - **Solution**: Group related state into objects or use `useReducer` for complex logic.
4. **Forgetting Controlled Components**:
   - **Problem**: Not setting the `value` prop on inputs leads to uncontrolled components.
   - **Solution**: Always bind input `value` to state and handle changes with `onChange`.

---

## **7. Additional Notes**
- **Performance Considerations**: Avoid unnecessary state updates by checking if the new value differs from the current state before calling `setState`.
- **Debugging**: Use React Developer Tools to inspect state changes.
- **When to Use Other Hooks**: For side effects (e.g., fetching data), use `useEffect`. For complex state logic, consider `useReducer`.

## **Interview Questions and Answers on React `useState`**

### **Beginner-Level Questions**

1. **What is the `useState` hook in React?**
   **Answer**: `useState` is a React Hook that allows functional components to manage local state. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a setter function to update it. Example: `const [count, setCount] = useState(0);` initializes `count` to 0, and `setCount` updates it, triggering a re-render.

2. **How do you initialize state with `useState`?**
   **Answer**: You pass an initial value to `useState`, which can be a primitive (e.g., number, string), object, array, or a function for lazy initialization. Example: `const [name, setName] = useState('');` or `const [value, setValue] = useState(() => computeInitialValue());`.

3. **What happens when you call `setState`?**
   **Answer**: Calling `setState` schedules an update to the component’s state and triggers a re-render with the new state value. React compares the new state with the previous state (using `Object.is`) to determine if a re-render is necessary.

4. **Can you use multiple `useState` hooks in a single component?**
   **Answer**: Yes, you can use multiple `useState` hooks to manage different pieces of state. Each call is independent. Example:
   ```javascript
   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
   const [name, setName] = useState('');
   ```

5. **What is the purpose of the setter function returned by `useState`?**
   **Answer**: The setter function (e.g., `setCount`) updates the state variable and triggers a re-render. It can accept a new value or a function that computes the new state based on the previous state.

6. **Why is `useState` only used in functional components?**
   **Answer**: `useState` is a Hook designed for functional components as part of React’s Hooks API introduced in 16.8. Class components use `this.state` and `this.setState` for state management.

7. **What is the difference between `useState` and a regular variable in a component?**
   **Answer**: A regular variable resets on every render, losing its value. `useState` persists state across renders and triggers re-renders when updated. Example:
   ```javascript
   let count = 0; // Resets on re-render
   const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Persists and triggers re-render
   ```

8. **Can you use `useState` outside a component?**
   **Answer**: No, `useState` must be called at the top level of a functional component or a custom Hook. Calling it in loops, conditions, or nested functions violates React’s Rules of Hooks and can cause errors.

9. **How do you reset state to its initial value?**
   **Answer**: Call the setter function with the initial value. Example:
   ```javascript
   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
   const reset = () => setCount(0);
   ```

10. **What is a controlled component, and how does `useState` help create one?**
    **Answer**: A controlled component is an input element whose value is controlled by React state. `useState` stores the input value, and the `onChange` handler updates it. Example:
    ```javascript
    const [value, setValue] = useState('');
    <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />
    ```

---

### **Intermediate-Level Questions**

11. **How do you update state based on the previous state?**
    **Answer**: Use the functional update form of the setter function to ensure you’re working with the latest state:
    ```javascript
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
    ```
    This is important because `setState` is asynchronous, and relying on the current state value may lead to stale data.

12. **What happens if you mutate state directly instead of using `setState`?**
    **Answer**: Directly mutating state (e.g., `array.push()` or `object.key = value`) doesn’t trigger a re-render because React relies on reference changes. Always create a new object/array:
    ```javascript
    setItems((prev) => [...prev, newItem]); // Correct
    items.push(newItem); // Incorrect
    ```

13. **How do you manage an object as state with `useState`?**
    **Answer**: Initialize the state as an object and update it using the spread operator to preserve existing properties:
    ```javascript
    const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: '', age: 0 });
    setUser((prev) => ({ ...prev, name: 'Alice' }));
    ```

14. **How do you handle arrays with `useState`?**
    **Answer**: Use array methods like `map`, `filter`, or spread to create a new array for updates:
    ```javascript
    const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);
    setTodos((prev) => [...prev, 'New Todo']);
    ```

15. **What is lazy initialization in `useState`, and when is it useful?**
    **Answer**: Lazy initialization involves passing a function to `useState` to compute the initial state, which runs only once during the first render. It’s useful for expensive computations:
    ```javascript
    const [value, setValue] = useState(() => expensiveComputation());
    ```

16. **Why does React batch state updates?**
    **Answer**: React batches multiple `setState` calls within the same event handler to optimize performance by reducing the number of re-renders. Example:
    ```javascript
    const handleClick = () => {
      setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
      setCount((prev) => prev + 1); // Batched, one re-render
    };
    ```

17. **How do you handle multiple form inputs with a single `useState`?**
    **Answer**: Use an object to store all form fields and update dynamically using the input’s `name` attribute:
    ```javascript
    const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ username: '', password: '' });
    const handleChange = (e) => {
      setFormData((prev) => ({ ...prev, [e.target.name]: e.target.value }));
    };
    ```

18. **Can you use `useState` with asynchronous operations?**
    **Answer**: Yes, but `useState` itself doesn’t handle async logic. Use `useEffect` or async functions in event handlers to update state after async operations:
    ```javascript
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      setData(await response.json());
    };
    ```

19. **What is the significance of the `Object.is` comparison in `useState`?**
    **Answer**: React uses `Object.is` to compare the new state with the previous state. If they’re identical, React skips the re-render to optimize performance.

20. **How do you prevent unnecessary re-renders when using `useState`?**
    **Answer**: Check if the new state differs from the current state before calling `setState`:
    ```javascript
    const updateName = (newName) => {
      if (newName !== name) setName(newName);
    };
    ```

---

### **Advanced-Level Questions**

21. **What happens if you call `useState` conditionally?**
    **Answer**: Calling `useState` conditionally violates React’s Rules of Hooks, leading to inconsistent hook calls across renders and potential errors. Always call `useState` at the top level:
    ```javascript
    // Incorrect
    if (condition) {
      const [state, setState] = useState(0);
    }
    // Correct
    const [state, setState] = useState(0);
    ```

22. **How does `useState` handle state updates in event handlers vs. outside them?**
    **Answer**: Inside event handlers (e.g., `onClick`), React batches `setState` calls for performance. Outside event handlers (e.g., in `useEffect` or async callbacks), updates are not batched, and each `setState` triggers a re-render unless manually batched with `ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates`.

23. **Can you pass a callback to `setState` like in class components?**
    **Answer**: No, `useState`’s setter function doesn’t support a callback like `this.setState`. Use `useEffect` to run logic after a state update:
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      console.log('Count updated:', count);
    }, [count]);
    ```

24. **How do you handle state updates that depend on multiple state variables?**
    **Answer**: Use functional updates and combine logic in a single `setState` call or use `useReducer` for complex state dependencies:
    ```javascript
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    const [multiplier, setMultiplier] = useState(1);
    const update = () => {
      setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + multiplier);
    };
    ```

25. **What is the role of the dependency array in relation to `useState`?**
    **Answer**: `useState` itself doesn’t use a dependency array, but it’s often used with `useEffect` to react to state changes. The dependency array ensures `useEffect` runs only when specified state variables change:
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      console.log('Count changed:', count);
    }, [count]);
    ```

26. **How do you handle deeply nested state objects with `useState`?**
    **Answer**: Use libraries like Immer or manually create new nested objects to avoid mutating state:
    ```javascript
    const [data, setData] = useState({ user: { profile: { name: '' } } });
    setData((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      user: { ...prev.user, profile: { ...prev.user.profile, name: 'Alice' } },
    }));
    ```

27. **Can you use `useState` in a custom Hook?**
    **Answer**: Yes, custom Hooks can use `useState` to encapsulate reusable state logic:
    ```javascript
    function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);
      const increment = () => setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
      return [count, increment];
    }
    ```

28. **How does `useState` behave in concurrent rendering (React 18)?**
    **Answer**: In React 18’s concurrent mode, `useState` updates are still batched, but React may prioritize certain updates (e.g., user interactions) over others. Use `startTransition` to mark non-urgent updates:
    ```javascript
    import { startTransition } from 'react';
    startTransition(() => setCount(count + 1));
    ```

29. **What’s the difference between `useState` and `useReducer`?**
    **Answer**:
    - `useState`: Best for simple, independent state updates (e.g., a counter or form input).
    - `useReducer`: Better for complex state logic with multiple interdependent updates or when state transitions follow a pattern.
    - Example: Use `useReducer` for a form with validation logic or a state machine.

30. **How do you debug issues with `useState` not updating as expected?**
    **Answer**:
    - Check for direct state mutations (use new objects/arrays).
    - Ensure functional updates for previous state dependencies.
    - Use React Developer Tools to inspect state changes.
    - Log state in `useEffect` to verify updates:
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      console.log('State:', state);
    }, [state]);
    ```

31. **How do you handle state updates in a loop?**
    **Answer**: Avoid calling `setState` in a loop as it can lead to performance issues. Instead, compute the final state and update once:
    ```javascript
    const updateMultiple = (times) => {
      setCount((prev) => prev + times); // Single update
    };
    ```

32. **Can you memoize state updates with `useState`?**
    **Answer**: `useState` itself doesn’t memoize, but you can use `useMemo` or `useCallback` to optimize expensive computations or callbacks that depend on state:
    ```javascript
    const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => computeValue(count), [count]);
    ```

33. **What happens if you call `setState` after a component unmounts?**
    **Answer**: React ignores state updates after unmounting, but it may log a warning if you attempt to update state in an async callback. Use a cleanup flag or `useEffect` cleanup:
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      let isMounted = true;
      asyncFunction().then(() => {
        if (isMounted) setState(data);
      });
      return () => {
        isMounted = false;
      };
    }, []);
    ```

34. **How do you share state between components using `useState`?**
    **Answer**: Lift state up to a common parent component or use a state management solution like Context API:
    ```javascript
    function Parent() {
      const [sharedState, setSharedState] = useState('');
      return (
        <>
          <Child1 state={sharedState} setState={setSharedState} />
          <Child2 state={sharedState} />
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

35. **How do you test a component that uses `useState`?**
    **Answer**: Use testing libraries like `@testing-library/react` to render the component, simulate events, and assert state-driven UI changes:
    ```javascript
    import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
    test('increments count', () => {
      const { getByText } = render(<Counter />);
      fireEvent.click(getByText('Increment'));
      expect(getByText('Count: 1')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    ```

36. **How do you optimize `useState` for large lists?**
    **Answer**: Use keys for list items to optimize rendering, and avoid unnecessary state updates by checking for changes:
    ```javascript
    const addItem = (newItem) => {
      if (!items.includes(newItem)) {
        setItems((prev) => [...prev, newItem]);
      }
    };
    ```

37. **Can `useState` cause memory leaks?**
    **Answer**: Yes, if you update state in async operations after a component unmounts. Prevent this with cleanup logic in `useEffect` (see Question 33).
