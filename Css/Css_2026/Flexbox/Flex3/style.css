/* Box 1 (flex: 1 1 150px)
Grow = 1 → can grow normally
Shrink = 1 → can shrink
Basis = 150px → starts with 150px width
✔ Normal behavior box.

🟢 Box 2 (flex: 2 1 200px)

Grow = 2 → grows twice as much as Box 1
Shrink = 1 → can shrink if space is small
Basis = 200px → starts bigger
✔ Fast-growing box.

🔴 Box 3 (flex: 1 0 250px)

Grow = 1 → grows normally
Shrink = 0 → never shrinks
Basis = 250px → always stays at least 250px wide
✔ Good for important content that should not shrink.

📱 Responsive Behavior Explanation
Try resizing your browser:
When screen is wide:
Box2 becomes the largest (flex-grow: 2)
Box1 and Box3 share remaining space

When screen becomes smaller:
Box1 shrinks
Box2 shrinks
Box3 remains 250px minimum (shrink: 0)
This shows the real power of grow–shrink–basis */
